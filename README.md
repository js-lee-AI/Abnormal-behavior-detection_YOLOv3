# Abnormal Behavior Detection for Corporate Internal Security
This project aims to prevent corporate internal security problems (especially data leakage through storage device) using customized YOLOv3.  You can find referenced code [here](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-YOLOv3). 

> Our code is not provided due to security concerns and it is Enterprise Cooperation Project.

## Demo
Demo 1 - She doesn't belong to ***Insider*** class So, it can't detect her face.

Demo 2 - She belongs to ***Insider*** class So, it can detect her face.

## Dataset
The dataset is about 9,000 images included a total of 12 PCs and 5 people.

Using **YOLO-v3**, I used images which is someone inserts storage device (such as USB) into a PC.

## Classes
Three out of five people were recognized through **face recognition**  and we call these ***insider***.

*- We pre-trained the face recognition model to recognize the faces of these three people.*

And the other two people, we call them ***outsider***. 

In the dataset,  we cropped pixels (unfixed-sized) that someone inserts a storage device into a PC visibly. We defined this class as **'PC_Vis**'. <br>
If a device is inserted invisibly, We defined this class as **'PC_Invis**.


Likewise, If a device is inserted into a laptop, We defined as **'Laptop_Vis'** and **'Laptop_Invis'**.


Finally, we defined a **'face'** class when it detects human faces.

## Customize
Face recognition was performed with YOLO-v3.

When a face is detected by YOLO-v3 (Does not distinguish who it is.), it determines whether it is an insider by calling a function of **face recognition**.

We just customized the YOLO-v3 model using only 5 classes (**PC_Vis**, **PC_Invis**, **Laptop_Vis**, **Laptop_Invis**, **Face**).

## Additional work
Additionally, a cam was connected to the Raspberry Pi for real-time detection. 

As soon as abnormal behavior is detected, beeps have been generated and line message has been sent via Raspberry Pi.
